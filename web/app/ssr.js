     * An example request hook. This function is called to allow code to

     *
     * This is an ExpressJS middleware function (see
     * http://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html)

     * To handle a route, generate a response and do not call next(). It's
     * okay to defer the response (for example, generate it once a Promise
     * resolves). If you do use a Promise, be sure to catch() errors and
     * return an appropriate error response.
     *
     * To let the route be handled by the UPWA, call next().
     *
     * The options object contains:
     * local: a boolean that is true if running in a local development
     * server, false if running in a remote SSR Server.
     *
     * The route is available via request.path
     *
     * The SSR Server provides a convenience method to generate a redirect
     * response to a bundle asset. See the comment below with an example.
     *
     * @param request {Request} the ExpressJS Request
     * @param response {Response} the ExpressJS Response
     * @param next {Function} pass control to the next handler
     * @param options {Object} contains the 'local' flag

         Here's an example of how to respond to requests for assets
         that are in the bundle by serving them directly from
         disk. Any bundle assets served this way must be in the ssrShared
         list in the 'mobify' object in 'package.json'.

         In general, it is much more efficient to use the correct paths
         for bundle assets (/mobify/proxy/bundle). The requestHook should
         only be used when the request path is fixed (for example, the
         robots.txt or favicon.ico files are always requested from the
         root of the site).

        // map asset to content-type & path
        const assetsInBundle = {
            '/robots.txt': ['text/plain', 'static/robots.txt'],
            '/favicon.ico': ['image/x-icon', 'static/ico/favicon.ico']
        }

        // Check if the request is for one of the bundle assets
        const path = Object.keys(assetsInBundle).find(
            // Use startsWith so that we ignore query parameters
            (key) => request.path.startsWith(key)
        )

        // If we found a match, send the file. If the file doesn't
        // exist, response.sendFile will return a 404.
        if (path) {
            const [contentType, buildPath] = assetsInBundle[path]
            response.sendFile(
                buildPath,
                {
                    // Directory containing bundle files
                    root: BUILD_DIR,
                    // maxAge for caching (in mS)
                    maxAge: (
                        // local dev server serves a non-cacheable response
                        // otherwise cache for 24 hours
